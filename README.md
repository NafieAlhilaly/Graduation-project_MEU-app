# MEU-app
This is my graduation project, I'm working on improving it as I improve my programming skills.

it begin with reading excel files as subject section then analyze them to give discriptive statistics
to measure the subject based on tudents scores.
then collect all sections for one subject and compare them against each others.

it can read one folder(assuming that folder contain all of your excel files for subjects' sections) or multiple folders.

from these simple reports we can generate more reports to measure performance
for entire College, Department and even an entire University like comparing a subject to others or its self over period of years.


please consider checking on the app, and give me your feedback because it will help me improve, thank you!
