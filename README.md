## General Information
- Read multiple assessments sheets files and analyze it and then generate reports for every section and then analyze all the sections grouped 
  together for entire course analysis/report.
- The idea came to help teachers at KKU(CS college) to automate this process instead of analyzing assessment sheets files
  with sheets apps.



## Technologies Used
- First version was written with Java.
- then I used Python for better data manipulation and powerful data analysis libraries.
- currently im working to make it as a web app.


## Features
- Automated the process of reading and analyzing assessments files.
- Reduce measuring error due to the automation.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ to make it a web app and provide an interactive dashboard to give better insight for the process of measuring and evaluating.


## Room for Improvement
- Adding interactive dashboard
- Add courses compare future to compare its courses performance either with each other or over period of time.


To do:
- Move the project completely to a web app to reach wider audience.
- Add interactive dashboards
- Integrate sign in/sign up to allow users to creat and analyze there assessments files.
